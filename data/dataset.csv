What happens during a typical peritoneal dialysis session?,"Thank you for your question about kidney health. there are several treatment options available for kidney disease, and finding the right one for you is important. Dialysis is a treatment that helps filter your blood when your kidneys can't do this job effectively.

Each type has advantages and considerations based on your lifestyle, health needs, and preferences. Your healthcare team will help you understand which option might work best for your situation. Remember that many people with kidney disease lead active, fulfilling lives while on dialysis treatment. Peritoneal dialysis utilizes the peritoneal membrane as a natural filter, with dialysate fluid dwelling in the peritoneal cavity to remove waste products and excess fluid through osmosis and diffusion.
